# lodash and underscore
Testing out two frameworks, Lodash and Underscore in a Nodejs/Express Environment

## lodash
(https://lodash.com) Is just a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.

## underscore
(http://underscorejs.org/) Is a JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects. It’s the answer to the question: “If I sit down in front of a blank HTML page, and want to start being productive immediately, what do I need?” … and the tie to go along with jQuery's tux and Backbone's suspenders.

Underscore provides over 100 functions that support both your favorite workaday functional helpers: map, filter, invoke — as well as more specialized goodies: function binding, javascript templating, creating quick indexes, deep equality testing, and so on.
